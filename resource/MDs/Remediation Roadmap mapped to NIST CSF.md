# Remediation Roadmap Mapped to NIST CSF
| NIST CSF Function | Immediate (0-3 mo) | Short-Term (3-6 mo) | Long-Term (6-12 mo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identify (ID)** | - Establish RBAC (role-based access controls) <br>- Start asset inventory | - | - Build full asset inventory and classification program |
| **Protect (PR)** | - Enforce Least Privilege (PR.AC-4)<br>- Strengthen password and authentication policies (pr.AC-1, PR.AC-7)<br>- Enable encryption at rest and in transit (PR.DS-1, PR.DS-2)<br>- Secure backup and restore processes (RC.RP-1) | - Document and enforce PCI DSS + GDPR processes (PR.IP-6) | - Launch ongoing security awareness and training program (PR.AT-1, PR.AT-2) |
| **Detect (DE)** | - | - Deploy IDS / SIEM monitoring (DE.CM-1, DE.CM-7) | - Implement continuous monitoring program (DE.DP-4) |
| **Respond (RS)** | - | - Develop and test Disaster Recovery / Incident Response Plans (RS.RP-1, RS.CO-1) | - Mature incident response playbooks and lessons learned (RS.MI-1) |
| **Recover (RC)** | - Implement secure backup and restore (RC.RP-1) | - Begin recovery plan testing and integration with IR (RS/RC alignment) | - Formalize improvement cycle: post-incident recovery improvements (RC.IM-1)
