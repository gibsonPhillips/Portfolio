# Remediation Roadmap
## Immediate Priorities (0-3 months)
---

ðŸ”´ *High-risk gaps that neet to be addressed right away to reduce exposure and meet compliance obligations.*

#### 1. enforce Least Pribilege Access
    - Restrict employee access to customer data and critical systems. 
    - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC)
    - Immediate PCI DSS alignment

#### 2. Implement Strong Password and Authentication Policies
    - Require, complex, regularly rotated passwords
    - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) when feasible

#### 3. Enable Data Encription (at rest and in transit)
    - Encrypt stored customer credit card data
    - implement TLS/SSL for all online transactions

#### 4. Backups and Recovery
    - Begin routine, automated backups (full + incremental)
    - Store using the 3-2-1 method
    - Document quick-restore procedures (and maybe back those up separately)

---
## Short Term Priorities (3-6 months)
ðŸŸ  *Controls that strengthen detection, resilience, and complience posture.*

#### 5. Develope and Test a Disaster Recovery Plan
    - Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
    - Test recovory processes with tabletop exercises

#### 6. Deploy Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or SIEM
    - Implement log monitoring and alerting
    - Start with host-based IDS; expand to network monitoring. 

#### 7. Formalize Compliance Programs
    - PCI DSS: Segment cardholder data environment (CDE)
    - GDPR: Implement Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
    - Document privacy notices and data-handling processes

---
## Long-Term Priorities (6-12 months)
ðŸŸ¢ *Strategic controls that mature the program and support scalability*

#### 8. Asset Inventory and Classification Program
    - Maintain and up-to-date catalog of IT assets (hardware, software, data)
    - Classify by sensitivity/criticality

#### 9. Security Awareness and Training Program
    - Train employees on phishing, safe data handling, and regulatory obligations. 
    - Include recurring compliance training (PCI/GDPR refresher)

#### 10. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
    - Integrate NIST CSF as ongoing governance framework
    - Conduct quarterly internal audits
    - Establish metrics for compliance and incident response

---
## Recap
- ðŸ”´Immediate fixes = access control, encryption, backups, and **compliance**
- ðŸŸ Short-term = recovery plan, IDS, documented compliance process
- ðŸŸ¢long-term = asset management, employee training, continuous improvement
