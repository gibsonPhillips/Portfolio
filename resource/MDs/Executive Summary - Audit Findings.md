# Unreal Inc. Audit Findings
## Executive Summary

Our internal audit of Unreal Inc. security posture identified several significan gaps in both controls and compliance. While the organization has implemented some foundational safecuards (e.g., firewalls, antivirus, physical protections), critical deficiencies remain that expose the company to perational disruptions, regulatory fines, or even reputational damage. 


The most urgent gaps fall under the **Protect, Detect,** and **Recover**functions of the NIST Cyber Framework. Employees currently have excessive access to sensitive data, password policies are weak, and no data-encryption safeguards are in place. These issues directly violate PCI DSS and GDPR requirements, creating a potential liability in both U.S. and international markets. Unreal Inc. also lacks key **Recover** controls such as a formal disaster recovery plan as well as routine data backups, leaving the organization vulnerable to data loss and business inturruption. Finally, the absence of an intrusion detection system (IDS) means that malicious activity may go unnoticed until after significant damage has occurred. 


To strengthen resilience and achieve compliance, Unreal Inc. should prioritize implementing **least privilege access, encryption, stronger identity controls, and backup/disaster recovery planning.** At the same time, the company should adopt formal compliance policies aligned with PCI DSS and GDPR. These measures will reduce the current high-risk score (8/10) and provide a structured foundation for scaling securely as Unreal Inc. continues to expand.
